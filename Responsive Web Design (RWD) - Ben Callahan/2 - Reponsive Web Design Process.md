# 2 - Responsive Web Design Process

1. A Myth about Process :imp:
    * Myth = each deliverable needs to look more final and :nail_care: than prev
    * Result = highly designed wireframes =  pictures of website vs actual usable websites 
    * planning happens at every stage
2. Content Priority Prototype
    * takes place of wireframe
        - real content, little css
        - linear layout, indicate priority
        - in html viewable in browser
        - created by content/ux 
        - markup not influence by design but by content
3. Style Prototype
    * fast :dash:
    * accurate :white_check_mark: web typography
    * show web interactions
