# Part II - Creating Hight-Quality Code (ch 5-9)

## Chapter 5: Design in Construction

1. Design Problems
    * design = messy, restricted, involves trial and error
2. Key Design Concepts
    * main goal of software design = manage complexity
    * good design = minimal complexity, maintainable, loose coupling, extensible, reusable
    * divide program into meaningful subsystems -> classes -> routines by restricting inter-communication and avoiding cyclic dependencies
    * design is heuristic = trail and error approach
    * abstractions = look at code at high level
    * encapsulation =  so you can only stay on level
    * information hiding
        - hide complexity
        - hide implementation, so changes are only local
